% \end{compactitem}

\affiliation[]{Breast Cancer Capstone}{}
\begin{compactitem}
\item Neural network was designed and trained against stained lymph node slides, from the Camelyon 16 dataset, to perform image segmentation with the goal of the detection of cancerous and abnormal cell structures
\item Cleaned, tiled, and masked the slide data and then fed it through a CNN to determine the presence of cancer and, if positive, through a custom UNet to segment it
\item Due to insufficient data, the accuracy rate was lower than anticipated so also attempted to create additional data using pix2pix
\item Tested both GPU and CPU based workflows for machine learning
\end{compactitem}

\affiliation[]{Private Satellite Imagery}{}
\begin{compactitem}
\item Worked on a demo intended for the United Nations that would utilize privacy preserving methods to pull data from satellite imagery without the end user every actually seeing the images
\end{compactitem}

\affiliation[]{CheXpert}{}
\begin{compactitem}
\item Utilized the CheXpert dataset to develop a potential low cost solution to detect chest pathologies deployed to Raspberry Pi via Flask with three other people
\item Using VGG16 we obtained a 79.15\% accuracy rate with a 50,000 image training set
\end{compactitem}


\affiliation[]{Federated Learning Cluster}{}
\begin{compactitem}
\item Created a federated learning cluster on a set of four Raspberry Pi 4s to have a platform to further explore how federated learning works
\item Practiced compiling Arch packages for ARM so I could use Arch on the Pis
\end{compactitem}

\affiliation[]{Noise Analysis on Android}{}
\begin{compactitem}
\item Worked with three others to compare Gaussian and Laplacian noise as the Laplace mechanism in differential privacy applications in an Android context
\end{compactitem}

% \affiliation[]{Cookbook}{In Progress}
% \begin{compactitem}
% \item Having tired of calling my mom to send me her recipes at midnight, I decided to compile them into a single space that was easily replicated and shared so my mom, my sister and I could all have a copy
% \item Used this as an opportunity to learn more LaTex while having fun and making something I actually need
% %\item Compile family recipes in LaTex cookbook
% \item Tech stack: LaTex, Git
% \end{compactitem}
